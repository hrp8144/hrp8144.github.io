      <h1>AI-Human Collaboration & The Job Market</h1>
      <h2>Choices:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gig-economy self-sustaining jobs</li>
    <li>Contact-to-contract workforce</li>
    <li>Personal choice & freedom on AI-Human collaboration within a job sector.</li>
  </ul>
      <p>The increased use of AI within business has also given rise to the "Gig Economy" which is a freely available choice for you to pursue. These jobs usually are short-term, freelancer-like jobs where you are independent, and are paid on a contract-to-contract basis. 
        This can be a variety of one-off jobs to short temporary hires for months at a time. The most common Gig Economy jobs you might know can include a lot of food delivery services such as Uber, or even hotel apps like AirBnB. Other independent self-sustaining jobs arise 
        in the case where a service is in short supply due to high consumer demand. Overall, it's inevitable that AI will drastically change how a workforce operates. In fact, a survey of 1,075 companies in 12 industries found that the more of AI-Human collaboration principles 
        companies adopted (principles such as standard business practices, employee involvement, cultivating and re-imagining employee skills, etc) found an increased overall performance in terms of speed, cost savings, revenues, or other operational measures. 
        A big disadvantage AI has is that what comes naturally to people (making a joke, for example) can be <b>tricky for machines</b>, and what’s straightforward for machines (analyzing gigabytes of data) <b>remains virtually impossible for humans.</b></p>

<br> I will now leave you with this closing statement: <b><i>"While AI will radically alter how work gets done and who does it, the technology’s larger impact will be in complementing and augmenting human capabilities, not replacing them."</b></i>
