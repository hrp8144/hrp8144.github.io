      <h1>AI-Human Collaboration & The Job Market</h1>
      <h2><u>Technology/Topic</u></h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is already a hot topic. It seems like in the last few years we've had a sudden boom of AI tools gifted to us. The current "big trend" for AI is to product results in response to our inputs, think for example ChatGPT or Midjourney.</p>
      <p>How many times have you opened up a support service chat, and it's very first prompt is to direct you to its services chatbot to help you? <br><b>It's a lot more than you think.</b> <br>AI-Human collaboration is already happening, any company can apply AI-Human collaboration in its different areas and already have a competitive advantage over those who do not apply such practices. </p>
