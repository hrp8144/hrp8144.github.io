      <h1>AI-Human Collaboration & The Job Market</h1>
      <h2>Risks:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI making jobs obsolete</li>
    <li>A loss of human independency or creativity</li>
    <li>Massive lay-offs to compensate for AI in the workplace</li>
    <li>General workforce safety</li>
  </ul>
      <p> It can be a somewhat daunting to imagine a dystopian world where AI has replaced most jobs, and have hindered the job market, making jobs obsolete to the average person. Let me be clear that this is a perfectly normal reaction to have. 
        However, this is not the case. Yes, some jobs will become obsolete, but new jobs will be created as a result of AI. What we do know for certain is that companies whose main goal is to deploy AI to automate processes in order to mainly 
        replace employees will only see short-term productivity gains. This conclusion was obtained by said research relating to the graph that involved 1500 companies, they found that <i>"firms achieve the most significant performance improvements 
        when humans and machines work together. Through such collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each otherâ€™s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and so on".</i> </p>

Why is this? It's because collaboration is essential, and one cannot succeed without the other. Humans can do as they please, while machines need an input and an output.
